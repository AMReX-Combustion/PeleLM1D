Fixed thermo for ch2chch2o  It had a slight discontinuty at the low to high temperature
transition point that was causing Cantera to complain.  
I kept the Hf and S298 the same as Nick Marinov's value and used the Cp's from
therm which were very similar to Nick Marinov's values.  I used this info. to make a new lst file 
and used that to make a new NASA coef.

I added hoc2h4o2 which was missing.  I made it the same as c2h5oh.
